## Meet the Family Challenge


### Objective 

### Write code to model out the King Shan family tree so that:

• Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in
which they were added to the family tree. Assume the names of the family members are unique.

• You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother.
