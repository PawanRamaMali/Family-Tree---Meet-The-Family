## Meet the Family Challenge


### Objective 

### Write code to model out the King Shan family tree so that:

• Given a ‘name’ and a ‘relationship’, you should output the people corresponding to the relationship in the order in
which they were added to the family tree. Assume the names of the family members are unique.

• You should be able to add a child to any family in the tree through the mother. 


# Problem Description
Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga & their family. King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you see!). Let's write some code to get to know the family.
